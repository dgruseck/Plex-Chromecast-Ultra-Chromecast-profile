# Plex-Chromecast-Ultra / Chromecast  Profile
chromecast.xml for chromecast ultra to direct stream 4K HEVC and lower


i made t his chromecast.xml so that i could stream 4K,1080p,etc  HEVC/h.265 and what not without transcoding using my plex to my chromecast ultra.  thats it, its not that special but it works great for me and i wanted to share with those that were having the same difficulties i was having.
